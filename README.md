# fly365 Code Challenge

try it [here](https://gitmibrahim.github.io/fly365-code-challenge/src/index.html) on Github Pages.

**_Note_**: 
- you may need to allow your browser to 'load unsafe script' on your browser because of the requested insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoints.
- to run tests, activate the test script tags at `./src/index.html`

### Framewroks:
* `Vue.js`
* `Vuex`

**_Note_**: I just started to learn `Vue.js` and `Vuex` by the past two days. So, I didn't use `Vue CLI`, `webpack` or `babel` to practice them separated in order to learn them deeper.

#### Should have been used:
- `Modernizr`

#### Should have been done:
- completing the unit testing for the rest of components.
_I've just learned `jasmine`, so I need a little more time to write more efficient and comperhensive tests_

- extracting `<script type="text/x-template">` to be standalone web components for a higher level of abstraction.
